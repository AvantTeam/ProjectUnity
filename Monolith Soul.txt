-------------------------------------------  MONOLITH SOUL  --------------------------------------------

-------- IDENTITY --------
	Souls are entities that inhabit the mechanical beings. Unlike most other culture of the mechs in the
universe, the "Monolith" people, also commonly referred as the "Monolithians", are not the living mechanical
components that exist. They do not have direct physical state, and they need to nest in one to persist.
The nested mechanical components themselves have to meet certain circumstances to support a soul's living.

-------- BEHAVIOR --------
	Souls need mechanical vessels to live on. Outside of them, they cannot persist for long and will die
in a short matter of time. Detached souls may target other physical beings to live on, or yield their
memory and energy to the current nesting soul, if any.

	Physical state affects the souls' energy. They seem to have more energy in a relatively powerful body.
The more energy they have, the lesser the energy containment limit they have in mid-air. The more likely
they will to fragment upon physical death.

-------- CREATION --------
	Souls are infused with large amount of power and the pure form of energies hidden deep below the
surfaces of Megalith, usually referred as "Archaic Energies". Once infused, the newly created soul must
be attached into a vessel for it to live.

-------- GENERAL USAGE --------
	Newly created mechs have no souls associated with them. With nothing controlling them, these mechs
would be inactive. Unit factories take souls and infuse them into the created mechs to give them life.
